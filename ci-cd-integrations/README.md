# Defender for Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)

Defender for Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool designed for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It performs static analysis and connects your code to cloud services. You can use it in any build process to scan container images for security vulnerabilities using built-in scanners. The results are sent to the Defender for Cloud portal, where the Cloud Security Explorer provides access to the container image and details about its vulnerabilities.
